      objective: 'Generate a short quiz from a wiki URL.',
      details: 'Implemented as a client-side rendered website calling several separately hosted microservices. The app first takes the input URL and requests scraped and transformed data from a service. Using the data, it then retrieves the most important phrases found, masks the most important phrases, and retrieves suggestions for the masks which would be used as alternative multiple choice answers. After all responses from the services have been received, the app proceeds to display the generated quiz. Created for a class project that required the use of Wikipedia and microservices. Worked on all but the image fetching service of the microservices-oriented project alone.',

The app first takes csv text input by file or text and retrieves corresponding market price data from a service. Using the data, it then draws the assets onto a web canvas as individual color-coded rectangles. Originally created as an entry to a finance-themed hackathon and later improved upon.

      details: "Youâ€™re studying hard, absorbing the material, and you are kicking butt on the assignments. However, rumors are flying that the upcoming final is known to ruin grades, and along with your other responsibilities it just may not be feasible to dedicate the effort you usually do give in order to get the grade you want. This is where Just Get Me By comes in. This is a streamlined desktop app that gathers your coursework, assignments, scores, and grades from your Canvas class(es) and tells you the minimum target scores needed on upcoming assignments in order to get that A. Created as an entry to BeaverHacks. Worked mainly on the data retrieval and processing part of the project with two other teammates asynchronously.",
